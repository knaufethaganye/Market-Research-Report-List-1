<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Leukemia Therapeutic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Induction Therapy</li><li>Consolidation Therapy</li><li>Maintenance Therapy</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The leukemia therapeutic market comprises three main types of treatment approaches: induction therapy, consolidation therapy, and maintenance therapy. Induction therapy aims to achieve remission by aggressively targeting leukemia cells with intensive chemotherapy. Once remission is achieved, consolidation therapy helps eliminate any remaining cancer cells to prevent relapse, often using continued chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Finally, maintenance therapy follows to sustain remission, reducing the risk of relapse through lower-dose treatments over an extended period, ensuring long-term patient management.</p></p>
